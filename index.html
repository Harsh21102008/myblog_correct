        <p >In my free time i like to read books. Be it horror, mystery, adventure or fictional, I always read them. I also like to read bio and autobiographies whenever i get bored mainly on soccer players. i read about 20 to 30 pages per day and like to do so. They help me to be knowledgable and informative.</p>
